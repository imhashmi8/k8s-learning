Helm Best Practices


1. Use "values.yaml" to manage configurable parameters instead of hardcoding.

2. Keep charts modular and reusable to simplify maintenance.

3. Validate charts using helm lint before deploying.

4. Store charts in a Helm repository for better version control and sharing.

5. Use helm dependency update to manage chart dependencies.

6. Implement RBAC and security best practices when deploying Helm charts.
