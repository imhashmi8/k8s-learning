Helm Architecture

1. Helm Client: Command-line interface (CLI) to interact with Helm.

2. Helm Chart: A packaged Kubernetes application that includes all necessary resources.

3. Helm Repository: Central storage for Helm Charts, enabling easy distribution.

4. Tiller (Helm v2): Deprecated server-side component that managed releases.

5. Release: A specific deployment instance of a Helm Chart.

6. Helm v3: Removed Tiller, making Helm more secure and client-based.
