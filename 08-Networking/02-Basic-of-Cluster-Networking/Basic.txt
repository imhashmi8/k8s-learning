1. What is the network interface configured for cluster connectivity on the controlplane node?

=> kubectl get nodes controlplane -o wide
NAME           STATUS   ROLES           AGE     VERSION   INTERNAL-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE             KERNEL-VERSION    CONTAINER-RUNTIME
controlplane   Ready    control-plane   4m59s   v1.31.0   192.168.231.135   <none>        Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS   5.15.0-1071-gcp   containerd://1.6.26

=> ip a | grep -B2 "192.168.231.135"
eth0@if52004: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1410 qdisc noqueue state UP group default 
    link/ether aa:4f:c1:f5:7f:e9 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
    inet 192.168.231.135/32 scope global eth0

2. What is the MAC address of the interface on the controlplane node? (Can find the detail from the above output)

=> ip a | grep -B2 "192.168.231.135"
eth0@if52004: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1410 qdisc noqueue state UP group default 
    link/ether aa:4f:c1:f5:7f:e9 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
    inet 192.168.231.135/32 scope global eth0

Mac Address = aa:4f:c1:f5:7f:e9

3. We use Containerd as our container runtime. What is the interface/bridge created by Containerd on the controlplane node?

=> ip address show type bridge

4. If you were to ping google from the controlplane node, which route does it take? What is the IP address of the Default Gateway?

=> ip route

5. Notice that ETCD is listening on two ports. Which of these have more client connections established?

=> netstat -apn | grep "etcd"
